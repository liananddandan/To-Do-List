### Project Requirement: Task Management System

#### **Overview:**
The Task Management System (TMS) is a web-based application designed to help users manage and organize tasks efficiently. The system allows users to create, update, delete, and track their tasks. It supports features such as task prioritization, deadlines, status updates, and task categorization.

The main purpose of this system is to provide an easy-to-use interface where users can manage their daily tasks, set deadlines, mark tasks as completed, and track progress over time. This project will involve both backend (API and database) and frontend development (user interface).

#### **Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users must be able to sign up and log in to the system.
   - Authentication is required for task creation, updates, and deletions.
   - Users should be able to reset their passwords.

2. **Task Management:**
   - **Create Task:** Users can create new tasks by providing a title, description, due date, and priority.
   - **Update Task:** Users can update task details such as the status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed"), priority, due date, and description.
   - **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
   - **View Tasks:** Users can view a list of all tasks with filters such as "All," "In Progress," and "Completed."
   - **Task Sorting:** Users can sort tasks by due date, priority, or status.
   - **Mark Task as Complete:** Users can mark tasks as "Completed."

3. **Task Categories:**
   - Users can categorize tasks (e.g., "Work," "Personal," "Urgent") and filter tasks by category.

4. **Due Dates and Reminders:**
   - Users can set due dates for each task.
   - The system will send notifications or reminders for upcoming due dates.

5. **Task Prioritization:**
   - Users can assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., "High," "Medium," "Low").

6. **Search Functionality:**
   - Users should be able to search for tasks by title, description, or category.

7. **Data Persistence:**
   - All tasks and user data should be stored persistently in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgresSQL).

8. **API Integration:**
   - The backend should expose RESTful APIs for managing tasks, users, and authentication.
   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) should be available for tasks via the API.

9. **Front-End Interface:**
   - A user-friendly interface should be designed to allow users to interact with the task list, create and manage tasks, and view progress.
   - The front end should communicate with the backend API to fetch and update task data.

#### **Technology Stack:**

- **Backend:**
  - .NET Core (C#) for developing the RESTful APIs.
  - SQL Server or PostgresSQL for the database.
  - Entity Framework for database interaction.

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React or Angular for dynamic UI).
  - Axios or Fetch for API calls to the backend.

- **Authentication:**
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.

- **Deployment:**
  - The application should be deployable on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Heroku.

#### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up with a username, email, and password.
   - Users can log in using their credentials.
   - User authentication tokens (JWT) should be used for securing API requests.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Users can create tasks with the following fields:
     - Title (string)
     - Description (string)
     - Due date (date)
     - Priority (enum: Low, Medium, High)
     - Status (enum: To Do, In Progress, Completed)
     - Category (optional)
   - Users can edit task details such as status, priority, description, etc.
   - Users can delete tasks they no longer need.

3. **Task Sorting and Filtering:**
   - Users can filter tasks by:
     - Status (All, To Do, In Progress, Completed)
     - Priority (Low, Medium, High)
     - Category
   - Users can sort tasks by due date, priority, or status.

4. **Task Notifications and Reminders:**
   - Users receive notifications about tasks with upcoming due dates.

5. **API Endpoints:**
   - **POST /tasks:** Create a new task.
   - **GET /tasks:** Retrieve a list of all tasks (with optional filters).
   - **GET /tasks/{id}:** Retrieve details of a specific task.
   - **PUT /tasks/{id}:** Update a task (e.g., status, priority).
   - **DELETE /tasks/{id}:** Delete a specific task.
   - **POST /auth/login:** User login.
   - **POST /auth/signup:** User registration.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance:**
   - The application should load within 2 seconds.
   - API responses should be fast, with a maximum response time of 500ms for CRUD operations.

2. **Security:**
   - Passwords should be securely hashed and stored.
   - JWT tokens should be used for authentication and authorization.

3. **Usability:**
   - The user interface should be clean, intuitive, and responsive (mobile-friendly).
   - The application should support different screen sizes and browsers.

4. **Scalability:**
   - The system should be able to handle a growing number of tasks and users.
   - Database design should allow for scaling horizontally if needed.

#### **Project Milestones:**

1. **Week 1-2:** 
   - Set up backend (API, database schema, authentication).
   - Set up the basic project structure.

2. **Week 3-4:** 
   - Implement task CRUD functionality.
   - Implement authentication (sign up, login).
   - Implement task sorting and filtering.

3. **Week 5:** 
   - Set up the frontend with React/Angular.
   - Implement task list view, task creation, and task update UI.

4. **Week 6:** 
   - Integrate backend with frontend.
   - Add reminder and notification functionality.

5. **Week 7:** 
   - Test the system (unit tests, integration tests).
   - Perform UI/UX improvements.

6. **Week 8:** 
   - Final testing and bug fixing.
   - Deploy the project to a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Heroku).

This project outlines the key requirements for building a task management system that incorporates user authentication, task creation, management, and tracking with a robust backend API. It can be extended further by adding more advanced features like task sharing, priority-based notifications, or collaborative task management.
